Model v2.1 is current because it produces the requested end-to-end screening result. It retains the v2.0
array curves, adds numeric foundation, power/collection, GSU, SCADA, and civil curves, and assembles 100% of
a named physical replacement-value profile into plant physical DR and scenario loss.

It remains explicit Tier 4 where calibration is unavailable. The limitation is output grade—not output
absence. Promotion followed the owner-accepted Everglades M0→M4 experiment and exact dual-read parity.

## Delivered calculation

```text
qualified array demand ──> module + structure DR
qualified site demand  ──> foundation + power + GSU + SCADA + civil DR
named value profile    ──> same-unit losses
support-once rule      ──> total physical loss
                       └─> physical replacement DR
                           installed-capex physical loss fraction
                           scenario dollars when capacity is supplied
```

The primary runtime atom remains failure-unit DR. `physical_damage_assembly.v1` is an explicit convenience
view with a named denominator; it is not an untraceable whole-asset curve.

## Why this avoids the legacy defects

1. State probability and damage ratio remain separate; DR is `Σ P(state) × same-unit cost ratio`.
2. No physical value is silently treated as wind-immune. Every direct/civil value row has a numeric proxy.
3. Tracker calls require attained state and exact-system qualification; commanded stow is insufficient.
4. No anchored-logistic intercept subtraction is used.
5. GSU uses its own site-facility axis and value, not the array curve.

## Scope boundary

V2.1 delivers tropical-cyclone **wind-only physical damage**. Rain ingress, debris, surge/flood, and tornado
loss remain separately governed pathways. Frequency, EAL, PML, VaR, and TVaR remain Hazard-tier calculations;
BI and downtime remain a separate disruption stage.

## Version ladder

| Version | Role | Plant screening output | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| model v2.1/docs r1 | coverage-complete screening release | numeric failure-unit DR, plant DR, loss per kWdc, optional dollars | current; canonical screening |
| model v2.0/docs r1 | partial component research baseline | array component DR only; plant/value outputs withheld | preserved audit baseline |
| model v1.0/docs r2 human, r1 runtime | narrow Perry source-cohort alternative | one visible-module material proxy | noncanonical |
| model v0.1/docs r1 | strict evidence-only alternative | no runtime curve | fail closed |

V2.1 is canonical at screening grade after explicit owner acceptance, Hazard exact-pin integration checks,
and proposal-to-current dual-read/rollback coverage. These gates do not turn Tier-4 proxies into calibrated
physics or expand the wind-only scope.
